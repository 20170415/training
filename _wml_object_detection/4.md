title: Project setup
date: 1970-01-04

All the code used in this tutorial can be found in [this git repository](https://github.com/cloud-annotations/training).

`git clone` the repo and `cd` into it by running the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloud-annotations/training.git &&
cd training
```

To train our model we will be using the Watson Machine Learning Python Client. This allows us to train TensorFlow models much faster by using GPUs provided by IBM.

To check if you have python installed run:
```bash
python --version; python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python installed you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) from the official Python website. Or macOS users familiar with `homebrew` can install it by running: `brew install python`

Run the setup script:
```bash
python setup.py object_detection
```
> This will package everything we need into a `tf-model.zip` file. This can be uploaded as an experiment in the Watson Studio GUI or submitted through the python client (which is what we will be doing in this walkthrough).

## Login
Once the repo is cloned we can run the following script to conveniently prefill our credentials everywhere they are needed in the project:
```bash
python -m wml.login
```

> **Note:** If you are having issues with the login script or want to enter your credentials manually, just create a `.credentials_wml` file and add your credentials as follows:
* ML_USERNAME=`your_ml_username`
* ML_PASSWORD=`your_ml_password`
* ML_INSTANCE=`your_ml_instance`
* ACCESS_KEY_ID=`your_access_key_id`
* SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`your_secret_access_key`
