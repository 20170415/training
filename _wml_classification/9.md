**macOS + Homebrew**

If you have Homebrew installed, simply run:
```
brew install protobuf
```

**Windows / Linux / macOS**

The simplest way to install the protocol compiler is to download a pre-built binary from the [protobuf release page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)

You can find pre-built binaries in zip packages: `protoc-{version}-{platform}.zip`
