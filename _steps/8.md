The code for the webapp can be found in [this git repository](https://github.com/bourdakos1/object-detection-react-app).

`git clone` the repo and `cd` into it by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bourdakos1/object-detection-react-app.git &&
cd object-detection-react-app
```

Move the `web_model` directory from the previous step into the `public` folder of this new repo

**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

Install the dependencies:
### `npm install`

Start the webapp:
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
